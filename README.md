# Complementaí

## :pencil2: Description

GAC (Gerenciador de Atividades Complementares) it's a platform that enables students to submit their complementary activities, reviewers to evaluate and either approve or reject those activities, and administrators to efficiently manage the entire system.

## :computer: How to run

After cloning the repository and running the `npm i` command to install all the required dependencies, there are just a few more steps to ensure the application runs correctly.

In this project, we use an API and connect to it using `Axios lib`. To start the application, simply run the command `npm run dev`. This will execute the project and launch it successfully. If you skip this step, the application will not function properly.
